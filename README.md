# CS430-Jonathan-Bral

The 'final' directory, contains the contents of my final project.
A Flask web-app that functions as a to-do list, and implements the [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

This project was deployed via [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/); however, I have since disabled the cluster, so this app is no longer running on any server.
